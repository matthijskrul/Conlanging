## Old Dwarvish (Zhanîm) Syntax

### (currently unfinished)

### General structure and ordering:

*Word Order and Headedness*. The general (unmarked) word order of Old Dwarvish is SOV. Despite the use of case, in normal sentence structure this is fairly strict. The headedness parameter is generally final, including in (NN) compounds.

*Element Order*. In Old Dwarvish there is a combination of postpositions and phrasal clitics for adpositional phrases; manner adverbs precede regular adverbs which precede verbs; adjectives and numerals follow the noun; demonstratives and quantifiers are cliticized after the phrase. The genitive precedes the possessed noun.

### Nouns:

*Noun Classes*. Old Dwarvish is characterized by an extensive system of noun classes, describing both singular and plural number, arranged by a combination of semantic and phonological criteria (with, at this stage, the semantic dominating). The noun class structure of Old Dwarvish is inherited directly from Proto-Dwarvish, subject of course to sound change. The organization is as follows:

I: 	Masculine humanoids; current or occasional agent			
II: 	Feminine humanoids; professional or habitual agent  
III: 	Plural of classes I & II; 'people' or 'nation'  
IV: 	Big things, augmentatives, valuable materials, large tools, stones  
V: 	Small objects, diminutives, (small) tools, small animals, etc  
VI: 	Plural of IV & V  
VII: 	Larger animals, fish, foodstuffs, textiles, some raw materials  
VIII: 	Plants, some natural phenomena, other sentients  
IX: 	Plural of VII-VIII  
X: 	Body parts, kinship terms, parts of things  
XI: 	Plural of X  
XII: 	Place, certain abstractions derived from space (eg time)  
XIII: 	Plural of XII  
XIV: 	Stative abstractions, emotions  
XV: 	Plural of XIV  
XVI: 	Collective nouns, uncountables, verbal nouns  
XVII: Things found in pairs, clusters, interpersonal/social things, lang.  
XVIII: Plural of XVI and XVII (uncountables have no plural)  
XIX: 	Opposites, negative or harmful nouns; dangerous things  
XX: 	Natural products, fire, liquids  
XXI: 	Plurals of XIX and XX  

The noun classes are characterized by the use of a prefix, variable by noun class. These prefixes agree with the noun class but do not apply to the nouns themselves. Instead, they prefix to verbs, adjectives, adnominal demonstratives, numerals (insofar used adjectively), and determiners.

The system of noun class prefixes is as follows:

I: ya-  
II: va-  
III: yaya-  
IV: tsa-  
V: ngi-  
VI:	ma-  
VII: va-  
VIII:	su-  
IX:	na-  
X: kha-  
XI:	nakha-  
XII: sha-  
XIII:	shasha-  
XIV: shiya-  
XV:	shasha-  
XVI: p'a-  
XVII:	t'a-  
XVIII: t'ata-  
XIX: gu-  
XX: wu-  
XXI: ska-  

Note that there is synthesis (?) between several noun classes, in part due to sound change: II and VII carry the same prefix, and so do XIII and XV. Since the latter two are both plural classes, it could be argued they have effectively merged.

Furthermore, note that the prefixes are subject to phonological rules in their application, including but not limited to:
- Those ending on -u become -o when followed by k, g, k' or q', and when the first syllabic vowel of the root form (to which the prefix is attached) is a.
- In Proto-Dwarvish, any consonant following the final vowel of the prefix geminated. This process became irregular in Old Dwarvish, applying only to unaspirated stops, m, and n. However, the sound changes induced by gemination in previous cases were preserved, leading occasionally to unexpected consonant changes in the root. (For example, **yazzikha*, 'c1-fast' in Proto-Dwarvish, leads to Old Dwarvish ya-zhikha via sound change.)
- For root forms starting on a vowel, the noun class prefixes lose their final vowel in favor of the root initial vowel; except for VIII, XIX and XX, the prefixes on -u, which suppress the root initial vowel instead.

*Noun Cases*.

Baroquely, Old Dwarvish has besides the noun class system also an extensive system of case inflection. These cases apply to nouns, independent pronouns, and pronominal demonstratives (eg English 'that' when used independently). There is no case agreement for any other elements, including adjectives.

The case structure includes neutral, nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, essive, instrumental, and ablative.  
 The neutral case represents the agent of an intransitive verb.  
 The nominative represents the subject of a transitive verb.  
 The genitive is used for possessive constructions (and applies to the possessor). (Reminder: the genitive precedes the possessed noun.) It is also used for partitive constructions.  
 The dative is applied to the recipient or beneficiary of an action, and as the subject of certain dative experiencer constructions.  
 The accusative represents the object of a transitive verb.  
 The locative governs the noun affected by a number of spatial and temporal postpositions/enclitics.  
 The essive is complex: it represents a state of being ('as a...'), a temporary condition ('while being a...') which also applies to certain time related phrases ('on/at <X time point>), and in past tense contexts implies a past period ('when X was a...'). Moreover, in this period it is also used in simple sentences as a predicate existential if used instead of a noun subject: 'it is X...' or 'there is X'. The instrumental applies to a noun used in the process of something else ('by means of...').  
 Unlike some languages, in Old Dwarvish the instrumental is not also a comitative. It applies frequently to abstract constructions. It can also be applied to the subject of a transitive verb, in the subject position, to render the meaning of that verb passive.  
 Finally, the ablative is comparable to the locative, in that it governs the noun affected by spatial postpositions or enclitics, but the ablative applies to motion whereas the locative applies to position (cf. accusative vs dative in German, or 'in' vs 'into' in English).

The suffixes indicating case are organized as follows:

NOM:	0  
NTR:	gemination + a  
GEN:	gemination + redupl. of final VC (e.g. *yan* → *yannan*, *k’ur* → *k’urrur*)  
DAT: 	gemination + -ôq (*yan* -> *yannôq*)\
ACC:	gemination + i + final C again (*yan* -> *yannin*)\
LOC: 	-bul  
ESS: 	-a  
INS:	-nū  
ABL: 	-thi  

### Adjectives:

Old Dwarvish has an open class of independent modifying adjectives. These take noun class prefixes but do not agree with case. Adjectives follow the noun they modify. Note that Old Dwarvish has a very limited set of root color adjectives: only 'light', 'dark', and 'colored', the last one indicating roughly the red-orange-yellow spectrum. More precise colors are usually indicated with reference to representative objects.

### Articles:

There are no articles.

### Numerals:

Numerals are lexically independent items. When used adjectivally, they are treated as such, and when used independently can stand on their own (e.g. in predicate nominal constructions). Adjectivally, they come after the noun, and before any other modifiers. Old Dwarvish uses a base-10 counting system, although not all numerals 1-10 have underived forms, and there are root forms for certain higher numerals. (E.g. *q'iqqâs*, 'eight', is probably derived from 'two-four'.)

### Demonstratives and Interrogatives:

Demonstrative adjectives appear as enclitics on the noun phrase, following on the last element of the noun phrase (for example a modifier). Demonstratives used as pronouns are independent lexical items and take case (as mentioned under 'Noun Cases' above). The same thing applies to interrogative pronouns, which are also independent lexical items and take case. Like all question structures, a clause or sentence with an interrogative pronoun requires an interrogative particle in sentence final position.

As with many languages, Old Dwarvish has three degrees of distance in demonstratives.
