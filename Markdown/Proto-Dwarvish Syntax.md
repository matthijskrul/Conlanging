## Proto-Dwarvish Morphosyntax Overview

### General Structure and Ordering:

In Proto-Dwarvish, the general word order was SOV. It was a strongly dependent marking language in VPs, with extensive use of case marking. The headedness alignment was generally strongly head final, e.g. in the NN compounds Proto-Dwarvish favored.

Proto-Dwarvish used postpositions; genitives precede possessors; manner adverbs modifying verbs in degree ('very' etc) preceded other adverbs, which preceded verbs (but always followed objects); adjectives and numerals come after nouns they modify (see further below).

### Noun classes:

Proto-Dwarvish has 21 noun classes, ordered conventionally by number. The noun classes are ordered semantically and to some extent phonologically. Verbs, adjectives, numerals, determiners, and adnominal demonstratives agree with the noun class of the noun they modify, with separate prefixes (given in a subsequent table below). Note that by substituting a different noun class marker for a given root, the lexical meaning of the root can be altered. They are as follows, providing the rough semantic categories:

*Class*:

I: Masculine humanoids; current or occasional agent  
II: Feminine humanoids; professional or habitual agent  
III: Plural of classes I & II; 'people' or 'nation'  
IV: Big things, augmentatives, valuable materials, large tools, stones  
V: Small objects, diminutives, (small) tools, small animals, etc  
VI: Plural of IV & V  
VII: Larger animals, fish, foodstuffs, textiles, some raw materials  
VIII: Plants, some natural phenomena, other sentients  
IX: Plural of VII-VIII  
X: Body parts, kinship terms, parts of things  
XI: Plural of X  
XII: Place, certain abstractions derived from space (eg time)  
XIII: Plural of XII  
XIV: Stative abstractions, emotions  
XV: Plural of XIV  
XVI: Collective nouns, uncountables, verbal nouns  
XVII: Things found in pairs, clusters, interpersonal/social things, lang.  
XVIII: Plural of XVI and XVII (uncountables have no plural)  
XIX: Opposites, negative or harmful nouns; dangerous things  
XX: Natural products, fire, liquids  
XXI: Plurals of XIX and XX  

NB: Unlike many noun class languages, the noun itself does not carry a noun class prefix! Only the agreeing syntactic elements do.

### Classifiers:

Proto-Dwarvish had a ‘concord’ classifier system, where verbs, adjectives, numerals, determiners, and adnominal demonstratives acquire a prefix according to the noun class of the agent. In proto-Dwarvish, the prefixes are as follows (with indications of theorized origin):

I:	ya- (*yan*, "dwarf")  
II: 	ba- (*ban*, "woman")  
III:	yaya-  
IV: 	tsa- (*tsal*, "rock") (later only used in compounds)  
V:	ngi- (*ing*, "gem") (rare VC root)  
VI:	ma- (?)  
VII:	ba- (*bath*, "food")  
VIII:	su- (*sul*, "life")  
IX:	na- (?)  
X:	kha- (*kham*, "part")  
XI:	nakha- (?)  
XII:	sha- (*shal*, "place")  
XIII:	shasha-  
XIV:	shya- (*shya*, "feeling, sense")  
XV:	shyasha  
XVI:	p'a- (*p’al*, "whole")  
XVII:	 t'a- (*t’ay*, "group, cluster, bunch")  
XVIII: t'ata-  
XIX: gu- (?)  
XX: wu- (?)  
XXI: ska- (?)  

Each of the prefixes is followed by a gemination of the consonant of the following word; e.g.: *pshaq* ("fish") -> *yan yappshaq* ("the dwarf fishes"). This follows phonological rules, such as the sibilant gemination rules.

Subjects in the nominative case have the same prefixes; the concord system does not agree with case.

### Articles:

There were no articles of any kind.

### Cases:

In addition to the noun class system, Proto-Dwarvish is characterized by an extensive case marking system. Case applies to nouns, independent pronouns, and pronominal demonstratives. There is however no agreement in Proto-Dwarvish between nouns and adjectives, numerals, etc with regard to case (as opposed to noun class). Because of the tripartite agent/nominative/accusative verb alignment system, there is a 'neutral' case for agents of intransitive verbs. Including this neutral case, there are a total of nine cases. Note that a pronominal subject of a verb is cliticized/prefixed on the verb instead of being subject to case marking as an independent pronoun (although for emphasis or contrast double marking is possible).

Case marking is achieved on nouns by means of suffixes, as follows:

NOM:	0  
NTR:	gemination + a  
GEN:	gemination + redupl. of final VC (e.g. *yan* → *yannan*, *k’ur* → *k’urrur*)  
DAT: 	gemination + -uq (*yan* -> *yannuq*)  
ACC:	gemination + i + final C again (*yan* -> *yannin*)\
LOC: 	-bul  
ESS: 	-'ah  
INS:	-num  
ABL: 	-thi  

Genitives are used for possessives and partitives; datives for beneficiaries ('for', 'to'); accusatives for the patients of transitive nonmotion verbs; locatives for most locative clauses ('at'); essives for manner or being or a sense of duration ('as...', 'while...', 'being...'); instrumentatives are used to indicate instrumental use ('with...'), but not (unlike some languages) a comitative, for which a separate clitic is used; the ablative is used to indicate various kinds of motion, particularly away from (including over or under), as well as temporal uses such as 'before' and 'after', and finally comparatives, whereas the locative by contrast indicates action in place (compare 'on' vs 'on to'). The ablative also combines with derivational suffixes indicating motion in specific directions in later forms of Dwarvish (q.v.).

### Pronominal System:

Proto-Dwarvish has a fairly simple pronominal system, but distinguishes pronominal prefixes from independent pronouns. The subject of a verb, if pronominal, is always prefixed to the verb if the verb is in the indicative mood. These prefixes are reduced versions of the independent forms (see below). Because only the subject or agent is prefixed if pronominal, the prefixes can naturally only appear in neutral or nominative case. In non-indicative moods the full pronomen is used where relevant (eg conditionals). Note that verbs, when so prefixed, come after independent objects (giving a kind of OSV structure).

Independent Pronouns:
The independent pronouns of Proto-Dwarvish form a simple three person singular and plural system. Each is inflected for case, as follows (note this differs somewhat from regular noun case suffixes):

|Case:|1SG:		|2SG:		|3SG:		|1PL:		|2PL:		|3PL:  |
|-----|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|  
|NOM:	|maw	  |'am		|gal		|nyur		|t'ush	|dshim |  
|NTR:	|mawwa	|'amma	|galla	|nyurra |t'usha |dshimma|
|GEN:	|mwaw		|'am		|glal		|nyurrur|tshut	|dshim |
|DAT:	|mwuq		|'ammuq	|galluq	|nyurruq|tshuq	|dshimmuq|  
|ACC:	|mwiw		|'am		|glil		|nyurrir|tshish	|dshim |
|LOC:	|mwab		|'ambul	|glab		|nyurbul|t'ushp	|dshimbul|  
|ESS:	|mwa'		|'ah		|gla'		|nyur'ah|t'ush'ah|dshim'ah|  
|INS:	|mawnum	|'annum	|glam		|nyurnum|t'um		|dshinnum|  
|ABL:	|mwath	|'ath		|glath	|nyuth	|t'uth	|dshimthi |

Pronominal prefix:

|Case:|1SG:		|2SG:		|3SG:		|1PL:		|2PL:		|3PL:  |
|-----|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|  
|NOM:	|ma-		|'a-		|ga-		|nyu-		|t'u-		|dshi- |
|NTR:	|mwa-	  |'a-		|gla-		|nya-		|tsha-	|dsha- |

Each pronominal prefix is followed by gemination of the following consonant. E.g.: disk ("eat") -> *maddisk* ("I eat [it]"), *glil gaddisk* ("he eats it")

Note that the pronominal system has an extra case. The 'neutral' case applies only to the agent of intransitive verbs and the subject of stative verbs; the nominative applies to the subject of active transitives, and the accusative (normally) to the patient of active transitives.

### Adjectives:

Proto-Dwarvish had an open class of independent lexical adjectives, akin to Indo-European languages. Adjectives followed the noun they modify, and the order of modifiers was strictly NUM-DEM/DET-ADJ.
Adjectives take verbal inflection (tense and mood) when used predicatively.

For Proto-Dwarvish only a very narrow set of color terms can be reconstructed: a tripartite division 'light', 'dark', and 'red/yellow'.

### Demonstratives, Determiners and Numerals:

Numerals were independent lexical terms, treated as adjectives (see above). Numerals follow the noun. The counting system is base-10.

Demonstratives (this, that, etc) were cliticized after the noun phrase, i.e. to the noun or any modifiers following the noun, whichever comes last. The same was true for certain quantifiers and distributive determiners, such as 'each', 'every', 'some' etc.

### Adpositions:

Adpositions were a complex matter in proto-Dwarvish. Many are not known for certain, since in the course of the development of Old Dwarvish (q.v.) they seem to have been replaced by new grammaticalizations in many cases, and adpositions turned into phrasal clitics. In any case it is known that they were almost all postpositional.

### Verbal Syntax:

This simplified representation of verbal syntax is as far as can be reconstructed from Old Dwarvish:

Root forms of verbs (normally) end on consonants, like other roots. To which are added transitivity markers, modal vowel suffixes and then consonantal tense/aspect suffixes, in that order. Note that there is no (further) separate marking of person or number on the verb, since the noun class concord prefixes already do this job (see above).

Only the indicative combines modal suffix with the full possible range of tense/aspect. Imperatives have no tense/aspect, whereas infinitives have only past, present and future (and appear only in matrix clauses). The conditional cannot be combined with the habitual aspect.

Note that often verbal roots are in origin zero derived from nouns or v.v. (in any case identical). The morphology then clarifies their use.

*Tense/Aspect*:

There are six basic tenses: past, present, future, gnomic/habitual past, gnomic/habitual present, and immediate future. Their suffixes are as follows:

PAST:	-l  
PRES:	-z  
FUT:	-zk  
HPST:	-mim  
HPRES: -miz  
IMM: -taw  

*Mood*:

Indicative: The indicative form of the verb is the root plus suffix -i-.

Infinitive: In the past tense, the infinitive form of the verb reduplicates the initial CV of the verb root. In the present and future tenses (the latter indicating a greater distance in time than the present), the conditional suffix is used additionally (and the final consonant geminated). As a verbal noun, the infinitive belonged to class XVI.

Conditional/Optative: The conditional form of the verb has the suffix -a-. The conditional is used together with conditional conjunctions X ('if') and X ('unless'). If used without such conjunctions and with a single verb clause, it has an optative meaning.

Imperative: The imperative is simply the verb root.

*Transitivity, volition and telicity*:

Transitivity and telicity interact, in particular for transitive verbs. Experiencer/stative verbs (know, feel, think (of) etc) always take their object in the GEN case. Regular transitives take the direct object in the ACC for telic verbs and in the GEN for nontelic verbs. (The indirect object is marked in DAT, as commonly.)

Intransitive verbs are unmarked, whereas there is a transitivity marker that is compulsory for transitive usage; i.e. always for transitive verbs and for ambitransitives when used in a transitive manner. Most verbs, in fact, are ambitransitive, which explains the relevance of the transitivity suffix. The transitive forms often then have meanings in other languages indicated by separate adpositions, e.g. transitive 'go' becomes 'go for, go to get', 'see' becomes 'look at' etc. (In Old Dwarvish, this evolves into a general valency increaser, also from transitives -> ditransitives.) However, Proto-Dwarvish in some cases had suppletion for transitivity, with ambitransitive verbs appearing in two lexically different ways, rather than using the transitivity marker (eg 'eat').

The transitivity marker was: gemination of the verb root final consonant + uw-, followed by the subsequent affixes. (Note this essentially double marked with the case of the subject being in NOM rather than NTR.)

Finally, nonvolitionality is expressed by a reflexive in LOC, e.g. 'I dropped on/at me' = 'I dropped accidentally'. For experiencer verbs, this also applies, where it comes to mean something like 'I thought/felt unbidden'. This is also used to emphasize a semantically 'passive' sensation, e.g. 'I saw on me' = 'I saw it (without meaning to do so, without looking for it specifically, out of the corner of my eye)'. Note it applies regardless of transitivity, so that it could apply to 'fall' as easily as 'drop'.

### Derivation:

Nominal derivation:
By the nature of the noun class system, most nominal derivation is accomplished by the varying use of noun class prefixes; for example agentives (class I), diminutives (class V), collectives (class XVI), reverses (XIX), and so forth. Since noun class prefixes are compulsory, every noun is in a sense 'derived' in this manner. Nonetheless, there seem to have been a few suffixes used conjointly with the noun prefix. Important ones reconstructed are:
- Agentive: class II prefix + suffix -a
- People or language: class III + suffix -(n)im; similarly 'country of' is class XIII with the same suffix
- Tools/instruments: often names for tools, instruments, and objects frequently used in the process of an active verb are constructed as the nominalization of the verb in the instrumental case, where verb roots ending on a consonant cluster get -um instead; e.g. *disk* ("eat") -> *diskum* ("spoon"), which reanalyzes the syllables. These words are unevenly distributed across the classes, some according to semantic fit and some in XX (presumably more recent ones?).
- Adj -> Nom abstractifier (-ness): class XIV, stem + -ang
- Verb -> Nom nominalizer (generic): either zero derivation, or suffix -u; whereby in case the word ends on a consonant cluster, the u often metathesizes as a kind of infix (e.g. *ashp*, "to drink" -> *ashup*, "a drink"). The preceding consonant may also then geminate.
- Verb -> Nom (abstract noun derived from verb, -ness/-th/etc): geminate + -is or -in

Verbal derivation:
- Intensifier: reduplication of the stem, if monosyllabic, or else the stressed syllable (*zik*: "go" -> *zikzik* -> "run"). In case of reduplication, the stress does not shift to the second (reduplicated) syllable if it otherwise would (eg in various verbal inflections)!
- Noun to verb: usually zero deriv.

Other derivation:
- Adverbial derivation from adjectives (quick -> quickly) is accomplished, it is thought, by using the abstracted nominative in the essive case (when applied to stative verbs) or in the instrumental case (when applied to active verbs). Adverbs do not take concord prefixes.
- Verb to adjective derivation ('tending to ...'): aspiration of final consonant (where possible) + suffix -a
- Nom -> Adj: (-like, having the property of, -y): -iw, -illi


Note that unlike e.g. Bantu languages, N-N and V-N compounding is quite common and productive in Proto-Dwarvish and its heirs.
