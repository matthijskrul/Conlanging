Introduction
============

This is a small repository written using RST and Sphinx in order to show some of my conlanging work.
I have been teaching myself the principles of historical and comparative linguistics as a hobbyistic
project for about 2 years now, and naturally wanted to use the knowledge thusly acquired to develop
my own conlangs along more naturalistic and scientifically grounded lines. I have always loved con
langing, and although it is somewhat unfashionable nowadays among conlangers (I think), did not hesi
tate to apply them to your typical post-Tolkienian fantasy setting, such as one for my D&D games.
I wanted to develop at least one 'canonical' human, elven, and dwarven language, each with very
different features and principles. The human is inspired (among other things) by Austronesian and 
Polynesian languages; the elvish one by polysynthesis in native North America (albeit with a more
traditionally 'elvish' phonology); the dwarvish one has a heavy nominal syntax and takes inspiration
from Bantu and Australian languages. They are quite incomplete, some more so than others, and I tinker
on them whenever I have the time. In due course I might make other ones also. Each is, of course,
properly evolved from an ancestor, but as the conworld is my D&D setting, that information is so far
implicit. 

Of course, part of the exercise is also to teach myself the relevant markup and technical writing skills
using these conlangs as a template. Since the originals are ODT files made in LibreOffice rather casually
and laid out according to my own whims, and the grammar explanation is primarily aimed at people with some
knowledge of linguistics and conlangs (such as myself...), I have had much to improve regarding the
presentation, and that continues to be so. I used Pandoc to convert the files to a rough RST format and then
manually edited them for further clarity, although I would like to find a better presentation for the vocabulary.
On my Github_ repository for my conlangs you may also find other versions of the same files 
for practicing other writing tools, e.g. Markdown. The most up to date version will always be 
the one present here and published through Read the Docs, however. Over time, I will probably add more
files, for example on the proto-languages, as I find time to do the editing. Any comments are welcome!
