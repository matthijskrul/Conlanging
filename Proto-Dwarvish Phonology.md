## Phonology of Proto-Dwarvish

### Phonemic Inventory:

*Consonants* (IPA with Romanization where necessary):

m			n				ŋ <ng>

p ph <ph>	b	t  th <th>	d		k  kh <kh>  g	q [qh]	ʔ <'>

s	z	ʃ <sh>		j <y>		h

w 			r

l

p'		t'					k' 		q'

*Vowels*:

u~o(1)

i

a~ɑ(2)

*Diphthongs*:

ai au

1) Allophonically o before certain unaspirated dorsal + uvular stops (k, g, k', q')  
2) ɑ when unstressed

Note:
In an earlier stage of proto-Dwarvish, q and ʁ (probably once even G) were lost, but left traces on the language. The aspirated q took up the phonological space of the whole, whereas the unaspirated q became a glottal stop. The ʁ merged with h (via ɦ).

### Phonotactics:

C: Any consonant  
V: Any vowel or diphthong  
G: Glides and liquids (y, w, r, l)  
S: Sibilants  
P: Stops

All syllables must end on a consonant coda. The preferred root form is CVC. Valid consonant clusters are CGVC, SPVC, PSVC, mnVC, CVSP. Open consonants do not appear in Proto-Dwarvish (though they emerge subsequently), excepting CV, which primarily appears in certain grammatical elements (eg some suffixes) but can also appear as root, if considerably less commonly (this includes in the form of the above clusters, e.g. CGV, SPV, PSV etc.). Often proto-Dwarvish seeks to 'repair' or avoid CV by geminating subsequent consonants, but this of course does not prevent word-final CV in suffixation or prevent it from appearing elsewhere. CV therefore appears mostly in affixes and in the final syllables of roots (or derivation). CV may also occur as a result of deletion rules (see below). Ejectives may not combine with another consonant in the onset except glides & liquids (where the ejective must be first), with the exception of the combination sE (eg 'sq'...' or 'sp'...'), and may not appear in the coda at all. Glides may not precede another consonant in the onset.

### Synchronic Phonology:

*Consonant harmony I*: counting from the first consonant, stops that have an aspirated and unaspirated form must harmonize on the aspiration parameter in a given word, ignoring consonants without aspiration parameter, up to the first vowel (e.g. 'sp...' -> aspiration parameter of 'p', but 'sap...' has none). Affixes are included in this harmony. Ejectives are not affected. 'Sh' is treated as if it were an aspirated stop for the purpose of affecting other consonants (owing to historical derivation from an aspirated sibilant), but is not itself affected (any longer). Note that 'q' counts as aspirated, because at some point changed from /qh/! Therefore consonant harmony would turn later original /q/ into /ʔ/. However, since this happened early in the development of the proto-language, it does not uniformly apply; some words appear to have been introduced after this point, and those Qs are not affected (eg in '*pshaq*').  

Where two vowels succeed each other and neither are stressed, and the first vowel is preceded by a consonant, this vowel deletes.
Where two different sibilants succeed each other, the second deletes; except if the second is a sh, in which case the other deletes; and sh may not geminate.

### Stress:
Stress in Proto-Dwarvish was penultimate, with secondary stress on the first syllable in words of 5 syllables or longer. The exception is that singular vowels (e.g. the -i indicative suffix) cannot carry stress; the stress than shifts to the previous syllable.
